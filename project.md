# Project proposal

## Feasible topics:
- real-time object detection on smartphones (Open Images V6 dataset)
- medical image segmentation (brain tumors, pneumonia)
- music generation [MuseNet by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/musenet/), [tutorial article](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-with-tensorflow-part-3-music-and-text-generation-8a3fbfdc5e9b)
- super resolution in medical images using GANs [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01417.pdf)
- style transfer for text [resources](https://github.com/fuzhenxin/Style-Transfer-in-Text)
