# Project proposal

## Problem
Low-dose CT quality enhancement with deep learning

### Problem definition
CT is an X-ray based imaging technique, which obtains multiple 2D images and then reconstructs them using specific reconstruction algorithms. 
Image quality in CT is connected to the number of slices and the power of X-ray (dose). However, the amount of ionizing radiation is pretty high, 
and can be dangerous for human. We can obtain target images from low-dose CT procedure, but such images contain noise and 
can present difficulties in detection of abnormalities. 

### Goal
In this project, the goal is to apply deep learning, particularly CNNs, 
to the problem of noise reduction in low-dose CT images.

## Data
### Hospital data


## Evaluation
In order to evaluate the models, two metric are commonly used:
- Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
  - 
- Structural similarity index (SSIM)
  -
